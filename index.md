Welcome to our lab website! We are located at the College of Ecology, Lanzhou University. Ecological theories and experiments have shown that biodiversity is closely related to ecosystem functions (e.g., productivity, carbon and nitrogen nutrient cycling, and other key processes). However, in recent years, global climate change and strong interference from human activities have led to a sharp decline in global biodiversity, which affects the ecosystem functions, so how to slow down the loss of biodiversity or improve biodiversity has become one of the major scientific problems facing ecology and even global environmental science. How to mitigate biodiversity loss or enhance biodiversity has become one of the major scientific problems facing ecology and even the global environmental sciences that need to be solved urgently. For a long time, our research group has been focusing on the above major scientific issues, and carried out three long-term experiments. 

We are looking to recruit graduate students with background in ecosystem ecology. Please <a href="mailto: Liwj@lzu.edu.cn">contact us</a> if you are interested in joininig the group.
